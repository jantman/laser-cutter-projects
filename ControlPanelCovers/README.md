1/8" (3mm) Acrylic hinged covers for various control panels, to stop my cat from pressing the controls.

I originally planned on doing 3-piece hinges, with a center piece that's pinned to the bottom and top halves. That isn't going to work; I have no reliable way of drilling a 1mm hole in a pair of 1/8" acrylic sheets standing on end, and even if I did, the tiny little middle pieces aren't cut accurately enough by our Glowforge to fit and have the holes drilled accurately. Those tests are in git history but have been abandoned.

I decided that I really just wanted to get this done and move on with other projects. So, the current plan is to cut the pieces and then hinge them with a full-length piece of T-Rex clear packing tape. Keep in mind, this is a hinge that's used maybe a few times a month. The T-Rex tape seems to stick to acrylic well enough for this use case.

The final pieces were cut on a GlowForge Pro set for Proof Grade Medium Acrylic, Speed 165, Full Power, 2 passes.

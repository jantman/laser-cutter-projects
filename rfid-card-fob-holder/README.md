# RFID Card/Fob Holder

A holder/pocket for RFID cards and fobs to align and hold them over a RFID reader; designed for [https://github.com/jantman/machine-access-control](https://github.com/jantman/machine-access-control).

Each unit is made up of one top piece, two symmetrical middle pieces, and two symmetrical bottom pieces.

These are intended to be cut from 3mm (0.111" actual) clear cast acrylic. My usual settings for this on DecaturMakers' 100W Thunder Nova 35 (Brontē) are power 60, speed 25, 2 passes using the standard 2" lens, 6mm (large) nozzle, internal air.

* [top.svg](top.svg) - The top piece.
* [middle.svg](middle.svg) - Just a single middle piece.
* [bottom.svg](bottom.svg) - Just a single bottom piece.
* [one-up.svg](one-up.svg) - All parts for one holder.
* [two-up.svg](two-up.svg) - All parts for two holders.

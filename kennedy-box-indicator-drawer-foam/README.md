# github.com/jantman/laser-cutter-projects/kennedy-box-indicator-drawer-foam

Laser cutter project to cut 1/4" (6mm) EVA foam to make an indicator holder for the narrow, tall drawer of a Kennedy machinist box.

This was cut on a Glowforge Pro set to 300 speed, 100 power, 2 passes.

* Box: Model [520](https://buykennedy.com/product/20-7-drawer-machinists-chest/); other Kennedy boxes should be largely the same.
* Drawer: The tall half-width drawer on the left side. Interior dimensions are 218 mm widr x 186 mm deep x 50 mm high.
* Indicators:
  * Accusize Industrial Tools [P900-S102](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SG6CIVO/) 0-1" x 0.001" dial indicator (same size as many similar ones)
  * Mitutoyo [513-402-10E](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B079H8T1LV/) dial test indicator, with dovetail stem
  * 6-piece indicator extension stem rods, 1-6"
  * [TÃœRLEN](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043F776I/) 22-piece indicator tip set, in plastic box

## Notes for Next Time

* The drawer is actually one layer shallower than I'd designed for; omit the final bottom layer (layer 0).
* The DTI dovetail stem needs to be one layer higher; as is, it's very difficult to remove.
